"""
Shared completion-percentage calculation -- used by both the Employee
Profile endpoint and the Employee Directory listing, so they can never
show two different numbers for the same employee again.

REDEFINED: previously counted tracker steps being GENERATED (a step
marked "completed" the moment tasks existed, regardless of approval
state) -- this drifted out of sync with the Tracker's live track_status,
which reflects real approval progress. Now both use the same underlying
definition: 2 pipeline stages (Registered, Validation) + 4 tracks, where
each track contributes its FRACTIONAL approval progress (see
track_status.get_track_completion_fraction), not a binary generated/not.
