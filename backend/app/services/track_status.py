"""
Computes track and employee onboarding completion LIVE from OnboardingTask
rows -- never cached or stored, so there's nothing that can drift out of
sync with reality (see the earlier hardcoded-step-count bug for exactly
why that matters).

A track is "completed" only when every MANDATORY task in it is approved.
Employee onboarding completes only when every track has completed.
